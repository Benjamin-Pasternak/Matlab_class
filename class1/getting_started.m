% matlab is great for a lot of things! Many people use it as a companion in
% their mathematical work as wwell as an advanced plotting tool, image
% segmenter, etc...

% this semmester we will be going over the basics. Basic syntax and semantics
% How to write simple and complex scripts and functions. Some cool projects
% involving computation, data visualization, animation, machine learing and
% more time providing. 

% while matlab is technically object oriented, we wont spend much time
% covering this as much of the functionality of matlab can be unlocked
% without advanced programming knowledge. And there are other more capable
% langues for developing robust software such as java, python, C++ etc... 

% to many researchers, matlab is an invaluable tool for quick easy data
% processing, mathematical computation and data visualization. It is
% beautiful for beginners because it is known for being easy to pick up. In
% addition it offers a robust assortment of pre-built tools for you to take
% advantage of. This means less time coding and quicker results. 


% variable assignment 
x = 1;
y = 2.0;
z = 'grey';

% do most of your programming work in the command window below:
% try entering the above assignment statements into the command window and
% see what happens

%notice that on the right hand side you will have what is called the
%workspace. Here you are able to view and edit any "data" that you have generated
%during your programming work. Try clicking on a variable. You should be
%able to view it in more detale and also change its value. 


% you can print out the value of any variable by simply typing its name in
% the command window. please give this a try. 

%now if you have gotten annoyed by all the stuff thats in your command
%window you can simply type clc which will clear any thing from your view

% alternativly if you want to get rid of all of your variables that you
% have saved in your workspace you can type clear. 

% both clc and clear can be used as keywords in the scripts that you will
% be writing in the future. 

% you can use matlab like a calculator... 
% try typing 2*3 --> it will output 6! 
% as you have likly infered by this point, if you want to save this value
% you can give it a name by usint the assignment opperator = 

a = 2*3;

% in addition if you want to recall something that you have previously
% typed you can simply press the up and down arrow keys to call back.
